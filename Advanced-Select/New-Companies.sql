Problem Name: New Companies

Problem Statement:
Amber's conglomerate corporation just acquired some new companies. Each of the companies follows this hierarchy: 

Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the company_code, founder name, total number of lead managers, total number of senior managers, total number of managers, and total number of employees. Order your output by ascending company_code.

Note:

The tables may contain duplicate records.
The company_code is string, so the sorting should not be numeric. For example, if the company_codes are C_1, C_2, and C_10, then the ascending company_codes will be C_1, C_10, and C_2.

--Solution:

SELECT 
    c.company_code, 
    c.founder, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT lm.lead_manager_code), 
    COUNT(DISTINCT sm.senior_manager_code), 
    COUNT(DISTINCT m.manager_code), 
    COUNT(DISTINCT e.employee_code)
FROM 
    Company c
LEFT JOIN 
    Lead_Manager lm ON c.company_code = lm.company_code
LEFT JOIN 
    Senior_Manager sm ON c.company_code = sm.company_code
LEFT JOIN 
    Manager m ON c.company_code = m.company_code
LEFT JOIN 
    Employee e ON c.company_code = e.company_code
GROUP BY 
    c.company_code, 
    c.founder
ORDER BY 
    c.company_code ASC
